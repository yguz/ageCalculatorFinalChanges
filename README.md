It even plays a soothing sound and changes the background to match the season of your birth month. For example, if you’re born in April, you’ll see a springtime scene 
with butterflies and hear birds chirping.The app also lets you check how much time until your your next birthday. Just click the "Calculate Next Birthday" button, and
it will show you a countdown in months and days. If you want to go back, there’s a simple button to return to the main screen.
