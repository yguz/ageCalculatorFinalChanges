Age Calculator App
This Android app makes it fun and easy to calculate your age! Simply enter your birthday, click the "Calculate Age" button, and the app will show you how old you are.
It even plays a soothing sound and changes the background to match the season of your birth month. For example, if you’re born in April, you’ll see a springtime scene 
with butterflies and hear birds chirping.The app also lets you check how much time until your your next birthday. Just click the "Calculate Next Birthday" button, and
it will show you a countdown in months and days. If you want to go back, there’s a simple button to return to the main screen.
